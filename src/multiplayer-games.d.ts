// This file describes all the services provided by the gaming platform.
// See examples for the platform at:
// https://friendlygo.com/
// https://ycheckers.com/
// https://tictactoe.ygame.us/
// The source code for these games is at:
// https://github.com/yoav-zibin
// The game developer can host the game anywhere, e.g., the games above are hosted on github.io
// and you can reach just the game (without the platform) in these urls, respectively:
// https://yoav-zibin.github.io/friendlygo/
// https://yoav-zibin.github.io/Checkers_SMG/
// https://yoav-zibin.github.io/TicTacToe/
// Test these out and see what *play modes* the platform supports:
// 1) passAndPlay: two human players (or more) playing together on one device (passing the device around).
// 2) playAgainstTheComputer: a human player against the computer (on one device obviously).
// The first two play modes are also called "single-player", even though a more accurate name would be "single-device".
// 3) onlyAIs: this play mode is just for testing purposes, in which the computer plays against itself.
// 4) multiplayer: human players playing against each other using different devices.
// The match may have viewers (a viewer can't make moves in the match). The platform
// is responsible to passing and persisting the match data. Multiplayer matches can be either 
// speed matches (where both players are connected at the same time and there is a time limit per move),
// or ping-pong matches (where one player makes a move and the opponent gets a push notification).
// 5) community: a group of players playing another group of players, e.g., US vs. UK, 
// or male vs female, or beginners vs non-beginners. Each player in a group submits a proposal,
// and the game decides when to make a move (e.g., once the same proposal is selected 3 times).

// Your game must support at least the multiplayer playMode.
// All the other playModes are optional, and you can later specify (in the developer site)
// which playModes are supported in your game.
// When your game is ready, and well tested on major mobile devices (iOS&Android),
// you can submit it in the developer site:
// https://friendlygo.com/gameDeveloper.html
// You will also need to buy a domain name for your game (e.g., GoBackgammon.us)
// and set it up on cloudflare as described here:
// https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYopKyMarGSsJMB_i9nzyZYgGKi_vfYqltu96GshT60/edit#heading=h.auj9c2nm880v

// Althoug this API supports any number of players, the platform currently supports
// *only two-player games*. In the near future it will support multiple players.

// The *platform* is responsible for handling data (player's info, player's matches, etc),
// authentication, pairing up players, allowing players to chat, delivering notifications, etc.
// The *game* is reponsible for showing the game UI and passing the selected move to the platform.
// The game doesn't need to persist any data: everything will be handled by the platform.

// The most important object is gameService: IGameService, which allows the game to
// communicate with the platform.
// (See all the global objects below, inside the namespace gamingPlatform).
// IGameService allows the game to make a move (makeMove)
// or make a proposal in a community game (communityMove).
// The platform will call game.updateUI when the game 
// should change it's UI according to some state.
// (Similarly, the platform will call game.communityUI in community games.)
// So, in summary, in non-community matches (like passAndPlay, playAgainstTheComputer, multiplayer, etc)
// the platform calls game.updateUI and the game then calls makeMove.
// In community matches, the platform calls game.communityUI and then the game calls communityMove.
// The game may call makeMove/communityMove at most once after getting an updateUI/communityUI,
// and only if it's your player's turn (yourPlayerIndex == turnIndex).
interface IGameService {
  // Call this method exactly once when the game is ready to get
  // updateUI/communityUI (see IGame).
  // E.g., if your game needs to load any assets, then call setGame after
  // all assets have loaded.
  setGame(game: IGame): void;

  // After the platform calls game.updateUI, you can call makeMove at most once,
  // and only if it's your player's turn (updateUI.yourPlayerIndex == updateUI.turnIndex).
  makeMove(move: IMove): void;

  // After the platform calls game.communityUI, you can call communityMove at most once,
  // and only if it's your player's turn (updateUI.yourPlayerIndex == updateUI.turnIndex).
  // You must pass a proposal, but move may be null.
  // I recommend to pass a move when the same proposal was selected by 3 players.
  // Do not call communityMove if the player already sent his Proposals
  // (communityUI.playerIdToProposal[communityUI.yourPlayerInfo.playerId] != undefined), i.e.,
  // a player can submit at most one proposal.
  communityMove(proposal: IProposal, move?: IMove): void;
}

// Your game must support the updateUI method.
// The other methods (communityUI and getStateForOgImage) are optional.
interface IGame {
  // This method is called when the game state changes, e.g., if the player started a new match,
  // loaded an existing match, if an opponent made a move, etc.
  // The game should update its UI according to the game state (updateUI.state).
  // If it's your player's turn (updateUI.yourPlayerIndex == updateUI.turnIndex),
  // then the UI should allow the player to make a move (and the game should call gameService.makeMove).
  updateUI(updateUI: IUpdateUI): void;

  // This method is called when the state of a community match changes or when some player submits a proposal.
  // If it's your player's turn (updateUI.yourPlayerIndex == updateUI.turnIndex),
  // and your player didn't submit a proposal already (communityUI.playerIdToProposal[communityUI.yourPlayerInfo.playerId] == undefined),
  // then the UI should allow making a proposal (and the game should call gameService.communityMove).
  communityUI(communityUI: ICommunityUI): void;

  // The platform supports players sharing a match on facebook, and therefore the platform
  // needs a way to convert the match state into an image.
  // That image is also used in the platform HTML in <meta property="og:image" ...>,
  // which is why I called the mechanism to conver a state to an image 'ogImageMaker'.
  // (In the future, the platform may also send push notifications that includes an image of the state.)
  // Like communityUI, this method is optional: if your game doesn't support it, then 
  // you won't be able to share images on Facebook.
  // In the game developer site you can enter a URL (called 'ogImageMaker')
  // that converts a state string to an image.
  // The platform will pass your URL the following parameters:
  // * state: this is the string returned from getStateForOgImage()
  // * fbId0, fbId1: the FB ids of the first and second players (if these players logged into FB).
  // * winner: the playerIndex of the winner (either 0/1 or missing).
  // * onlyBoard: either equals to "t" (true) or missing.
  // If onlyBoard=t, then the URL should created
  // a square image (of size 400x400) that contains just the board. 
  // If it's missing, then it should create an image
  // that is approximately 1200x630 (that's facebook recommendation for og:image).
  // E.g., for the game of friendlygo I created an AppEngine that does this conversion, 
  // see the code here:
  // https://github.com/yoav-zibin/friendlygo-appengine
  // I uploaded this to AppEngine, and entered this URL for ogImageMaker in the developer site:
  // https://dotted-guru-139914.appspot.com/
  // This is an example of how the platform calls the ogImageMaker URL:
  // https://dotted-guru-139914.appspot.com/?onlyBoard=t&winner=0&fbId0=10153589934097337&fbId1=10153693068502449&state=wbbxxxxxxxwbbwbbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxwb

  // https://github.com/yoav-zibin/ycheckers-appengine

  // (e.g., you can't have DOM elements, classes, or functions in IState).

// To update the UI in both cases you need:
// - all the info in a move: state, turnIndex, endMatchScores
